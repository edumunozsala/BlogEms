This is my personal blog where I will be posting about machine learning and data science. Last two years I have been involved in a fascinating learning path, building some projects on ML that I am uploading to my github account. And the posts in this blog will describe some of them, explaining details or other relevant topics.

## My Education
In this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/GnxtiFm3/studies-personal-projects-on-data-science-and-machine-learning) there is a complete list of certificates, specializations and courses I have complete last two years. 

And there are links to some of my projects and blog posts on Medium.

This board is changing and evolving.
