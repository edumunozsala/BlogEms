# What is this blog about?

This blog is a collection of studies, projects and resources about some relevant topics in machine learning that I have developed during my learning path through this matter.
Initially the main focus is Natural Language Processing topics, trying to describe in an easy to understand waym some of its common tasks and problems and how to face them.

I am not an advanced practicioner or expert in machine learning, so I will do my best to make you understand the concepts but for a better intuition I will provide some other links to the topics in discussion.
I hope you find this blog an interesting stop on your own journey to machine learning.
